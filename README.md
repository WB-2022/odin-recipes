# odin-recipes
# This project is to demonstrate what I am able to
# code in HTML
# My intentions will be to take it from this simple 
# start to something that will contain all of my
# working recipes.  The start will catalog the
# recipes that will later be used in the program.

# Next I see the ability to add check boxes or drop
# down menus to mark the day of the meal.  This can
# be used to formulate a shopping list.

# Further it would be interesting to incorporate 
# cost of food inside each meal.  For this feature I
# would need to somehow capture the receipts from 
# the grocery shopping.
