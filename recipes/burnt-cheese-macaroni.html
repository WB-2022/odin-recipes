                <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
                <li>1 (32-ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or homemade sauce</li>
                <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Fill a pasta pot with cold water and set on a burner over medium-high heat. When the pasta water comes to a boil, salt the water, stir and taste. It should taste like the sea. Undersalted? Add more. Oversalted? Pour out some water and add fresh water until you get the right balance.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>While the water is coming to a boil, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, onion, bell pepper, and celery. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for about 3 to 4 minutes, until tender.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Add tomato paste and stir to incorporate into the vegetables, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Add the ground beef and season with another pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat, until no longer pink.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Add the spaghetti sauce. Bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>Pour pasta into boiling salted water gradually while stirring the water. When the water returns to a boil, begin the cooking time as directed by the packaging for al dente doneness. Drain.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>Add pasta to meat sauce. Stir to blend.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 9</h4>
            <p>Transfer half of the mixture to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish and top with half of the cheese. Add remaining mixture and top with remaining cheese.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 10</h4>
            <p>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until cheese is melted and the mixture is bubbly.
